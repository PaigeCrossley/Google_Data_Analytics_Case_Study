# Google Data Analytics Case Study
I recently completed the Google Data Analytics certification
The certification ends with a capstone project, performing your own case study. We were provided 2 topics to choose from or you can find your own. I chose the Bellabeat case study.

Bellabeat is a women's wellness company. They develop wearable fitness trackers for women as well as other health-focused products, including an app and a water bottle that tracks your water intake. Their fitness trackers are unique because they look more like a piece of jewellery rather than the typical sporty watch.
The purpose of this case study is to leverage smart device user data to influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy. As the junior data analyst in the scenario, my job is to analyze the provided Fitbit dataset and deliver the insights derived to the executive team which will then be used to influence our marketing strategy.

As the Tableau dashboard uploaded in this repository is a PDF, it does not have the tooltips that would otherwise be visible. To see it on Tableau Public, go [here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/CaseStudy_16897032981500/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
